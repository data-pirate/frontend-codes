                    <p>The Siberian Husky dog breed has a beautiful, thick coat that comes in a multitude of colors and
                        markings. Their blue or multi-colored eyes and striking facial masks only add to the appeal of
                        this
                        breed, which originated in Siberia.</p>

                    <p class="b_box">
                        <i>"It is easy to see why many are drawn to the Siberian‚Äôs wolf-like looks, but beware
                            because
                            this athletic, intelligent dog can act independently and challenge first-time dog parents.

                    <p>Siberian Huskies have captured the imagination of the masses, as well as artists, writers, and
                        film
                        producers, with their eye-catching looks and awe-inspiring talents. <u>This medium-size working
                            dog
                            possesses power and athleticism. First developed
                            as sled dogs ‚Äî some are still used in this capacity ‚Äî Huskies are remarkable dogs ‚Äî and
                            their
                            ability to
                            learn is staggering.</u> Many have fallen in love with the wild nature and pride of Huskies,
                        but
                        are
                        unaware
                        just what this breed is truly
                        like. This is not a breed for everyone. Their beauty often drives people to purchase them,
                        unaware
                        of
                        their difficult traits, which makes many Siberian Huskies prime candidates for shelters.</p>

                    <div class="highlights">
                        <h2>Highlights</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Depending on your climate, Siberian Huskies are generally low shedders except during the
                                times
                                of year when they blow their coat, meaning they drop large amounts of hair all at once.
                                This
                                happens roughly twice a year, more if you live
                                in warmer climates, and when it does, the breed becomes a heavy shedder for about a
                                three-week
                                stretch.</li>
                            <li>Siberian Huskies are not recommended for apartment living, but some do quite well in
                                apartments
                                if they are properly trained and exercised.</li>
                            <li>Siberian Huskies are known escape artists and have been known to wander away and
                                disappear.
                                They
                                can jump fences, break tie-out chains, slip collars and find any other way to escape.
                                They
                                need
                                a high fenced yard and the fence should
                                also be buried several inches below ground to prevent the Husky from digging his way
                                out.
                            </li>
                            <li>While they enjoy howling, Siberian Huskies rarely bark and they will not alert bark if
                                someone
                                comes onto your property. This makes them an unsuitable watchdog. The rap on Huskies is
                                that
                                they would aid a burglar before posing any
                                threat.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="size">
                        <h2>Size</h2>
                        <p>An average male stands between 21 and 23.5 inches high while the female averages 20 to 22
                            inches.
                            The
                            male weighs between 45 and 60 pounds and the female 35 to 50 pounds.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="Care">
                        <h2>Care</h2>
                        <p>Siberian Huskies need to be exercised 30 to 60 minutes daily to keep them from becoming
                            bored.
                            They
                            make excellent jogging companions, but should not be exercised in hot weather. Surprisingly,
                            they
                            need only a small (but secure) backyard
                            to expend their energy. Bottom line: Siberian Huskies need to be working to stay happy.
                            Usually
                            just
                            maintaining your own active life through hiking and other outdoor sports will keep you
                            Siberian
                            Husky healthy, happy and out of trouble.
                            As mentioned earlier, training is a must with this breed and you may want to invest in more
                            advanced
                            obedience classes. This can be difficult for many owners and trainers as the breed is very
                            intelligent and will determine the difference
                            between classes and home.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grooming">
                        <h2>Grooming</h2>
                        <p>Make sure your vacuum cleaner is in top working order and you book time regularly to groom if
                            you
                            adopt a Siberian Husky. His double coat features medium-length hair. The top coat is
                            straight
                            and
                            the undercoat feels soft and dense. Expect
                            lots of hair, lots of shedding ‚Äî especially during spring and fall when they blow their
                            coats.
                            That
                            said, this is a fairly easy breed to care for. Siberian Huskies living in cooler
                            temperatures
                            tend
                            to shed less than those who live
                            in warmer climates. You can avoid matting ‚Äî and excess hair on your furniture ‚Äî if you
                            commit to
                            brushing your dog's coat at least once a week during the year ‚Äî and daily during shedding
                            season.
                            Siberian Huskies are clean dogs and
                            will take the time to clean themselves ‚Äî much like a cat will. They don't typically emit
                            "doggy"
                            odor and rarely need baths. Unless, of course, they wiggle in something disgusting in the
                            backyard
                            or find a stinky body of water to jump
                            in. When it is bath time, select a high-quality dog shampoo designed to keep the natural
                            oils in
                            your dog's skin and coat.</p>
