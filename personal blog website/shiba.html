                    <p>The Shiba Inu dog breed was originally bred to flush birds and small game, and was occasionally
                        used
                        to
                        hunt wild boar. Theyâ€™re one of Japanâ€™s six native breeds: Akita (large), Kishu, Hokkaido, Kai,
                        Shikoku
                        (medium), and Shiba (small).
                        Shibas are known for their spirited personality, small upright ears, and cat-like agility. Today
                        they
                        serve primarily as a companion dog in Japan and the United States. You may find them in shelters
                        and
                        rescues, so opt to ado</p>
                    <hr>
                    <p class="b_box">
                        <i>"With his prick ears, squinty eyes, and curly tail, this breed from the Land of the
                            Rising
                            Sun looks like a fox, or perhaps a stuffed toy. He is neither. He is the Shiba Inu, the
                            smallest â€”
                            and
                            possibly the most ancient â€” of six spitz dogs that originate in Japan.

                            The Shiba Inu is known for a bold, fiery personality. The Japanese have three words to
                            describe the
                            breed's mental traits: kaani-i (spirited boldness), ryosei (good nature), and soboku
                            (alertness).
                            Combined, these traits make up the interesting, intelligent, and strong-willed temperament
                            of this
                            breed."</i>
                    </p>
                    <figure class="imagebox">
                        <img src="images/shiba2.jpg" alt="a shiba inu">

                    </figure>
                    <p>The Shiba Inu is small (about 20 pounds) and athletic. Like a ninja warrior, the Shiba Inu moves
                        quickly,
                        nimbly, effortlessly. He is keen and alert.

                        And superior â€” or so he thinks, according to those who know and love this breed. The Shiba Inu
                        approaches the world with a calm dignity that is uniquely his own, which is likely why he is
                        also
                        described as stubborn.

                        <u>Because of his independence, the Shiba Inu is not the easiest breed to train. Socialization â€”
                            the
                            process by which puppies or adults dogs learn how to be friendly and get along with other
                            dogs and
                            people â€” and training should begin early to teach the Shiba Inu proper canine manners.</u>

                        It is important to understand the freethinking nature of the Shiba Inu so you won't be
                        frustrated.
                        The
                        Shiba Inu is highly intelligent, but he doesn't necessarily want to do what you want him to do.
                        You
                        may
                        have to make him think obedience is his idea. For best results, it's important to work with a
                        trainer
                        who understands the breed's independence.</p>

                        <h2>Highlights</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Grooming is minimal for the Shiba Inu, though he does shed heavily twice a year.</li>
                            <li>The Shiba Inu is an intelligent breed who learns quickly. However, whether he chooses to
                                do
                                what
                                you ask is another matter. First-time dog owners or timid owners may be frustrated by
                                the
                                challenge of training this dog.</li>
                            <li>He's a small dog, but he's need plenty of room to romp. The Shiba Inu needs a home with
                                a
                                fenced
                                yard.</li>
                            <li>The Shiba Inu can be aggressive with other dogs and he will chase small animals he
                                perceives
                                as
                                prey.
                            </li>
                        </ul>
                    </div>

                    <div class="size">
                        <h2>Size</h2>
                        <p>Males stand 14.5 to 16.5 inches tall and weigh about 23 pounds. Females stand 13.5 to 15.5
                            inches
                            tall and weigh about 17 pounds.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="Care">
                        <h2>Care</h2>
                        <p>The Shiba Inu is best suited to a home with a fenced yard. He is an active breed who likes to
                            play,
                            take walks, or jog along with you. Giving him room to roam will help him get his ya-yas out.
                            Socialization is important with this breed. Like any dog, he can become timid or quarrelsome
                            if
                            he
                            isn't properly socialized â€” exposed to many different people, sights, sounds, and
                            experiences â€”
                            when
                            he's young. Early socialization helps ensure that your Shiba Inu puppy grows up to be a
                            well-rounded
                            dog because he is suspicious of strangers and tends to be aggressive toward other dogs.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grooming">
                        <h2>Grooming</h2>
                        <p>The Shiba Inu has a thick double coat that gives him a Teddy Bear look. The outer coat is
                            stiff
                            and
                            straight, and the undercoat is soft and thick. He sheds moderately throughout the year and
                            heavily
                            twice a year when he "blows" coat (imagine a snowstorm â€” but on your furniture and
                            clothing).

                            The Shiba Inu coat comes in orange-red, urajiro (cream to white ventral color), and sesame
                            (black-tipped hairs on a rich red background). Sometimes, there are white markings on the
                            tip of
                            the
                            tail and on the forelegs and hind legs.

                            The Shiba Inu is fairly easy to maintain when it comes to grooming. He is a naturally clean
                            and
                            odor-free dog. He does need brushing to remove dead hair and distribute oils once a week, or
                            more
                            often when he's shedding heavily. A bath now and then is necessary, too, but not too often
                            because
                            over-bathing will dry out his skin and coat. Many owners bathe the Shiba Inu every three to
                            four
                            months.</p>
