                    <p>The Golden Retriever is one of the most popular dog breeds in the United States. The breedâ€™s
                        friendly,
                        tolerant attitude makes them great family pets, and their intelligence makes them highly capable
                        working
                        dogs.

                        Golden Retrievers excel at retrieving game for hunters, tracking, sniffing out contraband for
                        law
                        enforcement, and as therapy and service dogs. Theyâ€™re also natural athletes and do well in dog
                        sports
                        such as agility and competitive obedience.</p>

                        <i>"These dogs are fairly easy to train and get along in just about any home or family.
                            Theyâ€™re
                            great with kids and very protective of their humans. If you want a loyal, loving, and smart

                    <p>It's no surprise that the Golden Retriever is one of the top ten most popular dogs in the U.S.
                        It's
                        all
                        good with the Golden: he's highly intelligent, sociable, beautiful, and loyal.

                        He's also lively. The Golden is slow to mature and retains the silly, playful personality of a
                        puppy
                        until three to four years of age, which can be both delightful and annoying. Many keep their
                        puppyish
                        traits into old age.

                        Originally bred for the physically demanding job of retrieving ducks and other fowl for hunters,
                        the
                        <u>Golden needs daily exercise: a walk or jog, free time in the yard, a run at the beach or lake
                            (Goldens
                            love water), or a game of fetch. And like other intelligent breeds who were bred to work,
                            they need
                            to
                            have a job to do, such as retrieving the paper, waking up family members, or competing in
                            dog
                            sports.</u> A
                        tired Golden is a well-behaved Golden.</p>

                        <h2>Highlights</h2>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Golden Retrievers shed profusely, especially in the spring and fall. Daily brushing will
                                get
                                some of the loose hair out of the coat, keeping it from settling on your clothing and
                                all
                                over
                                your house. But if you live with a Golden, you'll have to get used to dog hair.</li>
                            <li>Golden Retrievers are family dogs; they need to live indoors with their human "pack,"
                                and
                                shouldn't spend hours alone in the backyard.</li>
                            <li>Golden Retrievers are active dogs who need 40-60 minutes of hard exercise daily. They
                                thrive
                                on
                                obedience training, agility classes, and other canine activities, which are a great way
                                to
                                give
                                your dog physical and mental exercise.</li>
                            <li>Although they're gentle and trustworthy with kids, Golden Retrievers are boisterous,
                                large
                                dogs
                                that can accidentally knock over a small child.
                            </li>
                        </ul>

                    <div class="size">
                        <h2>Size</h2>
                        <p>Males are 23 to 24 inches tall and weigh 65 to 75 pounds. Females are generally 21.5 to 22.5
                            inches
                            tall and 55 to 65 pounds. Golden Retrievers usually reach their full height by one year of
                            age,
                            and
                            their mature weight by two.</p>
                    </div>
                    <div class="Care">
                        <h2>Care</h2>
                        <p>Golden Retrievers are built for action and love outdoor romps. If you like to hike or jog,
                            your
                            Golden will be happy to join you. And if you feel like tossing a ball in the backyard,
                            they'd be
                            more than happy to join you; true to their name, Goldens love to retrieve.
                            Tiring them out with 20-30 minutes of vigorous exercise twice a day will keep your dog
                            mellow
                            when
                            he's back inside. Slacking on the activity, however, could lead to behavior problems.</p>
                    </div>

                    <div class="grooming">
                        <h2>Grooming</h2>
                        <p>Golden Retrievers have a dense, water-repellent outer coat with a thick undercoat. Some coats
                            are
                            wavy, some are straight. The fur feathers on the back of the front legs and underbody, with
                            heavier
                            feathering on the chest, back of the thighs, and tail.

                            Golden Retrievers come in all shades of gold, from light to dark gold. Some breeders have
                            begun
                            selling "rare white Goldens," but the American Kennel Club does not recognize white as a
                            coat
                            color
                            for the breed.

                            Golden Retrievers shed moderately in the winter and summer, and heavily in the spring and
                            fall.
                            If
                            you live with a Golden, you'll need to adapt to a certain amount of dog hair in your house
                            and
                            on
                            your clothes.

                            The Golden's thick coat means lots of grooming. Daily brushing is recommended to prevent
                            tangling,
                            and once a week is the bare minimum. Your Golden will also need a bath at least once a
                            month,
                            often
                            more frequently, to keep him looking and smelling clean.</p>
